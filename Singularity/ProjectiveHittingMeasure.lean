# The hitting measure of the original projective random walk

Use the measurable limit selector of the actual PSL₂ orbit trajectory and
retract from the sphere to its real boundary. Under the lifted spectral-gap
hypothesis this selector is the almost-sure geometric limit. Its law equals
the already constructed SL₂ hitting law, not merely a stationary measure.
